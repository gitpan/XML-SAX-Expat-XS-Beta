XML::SAX::Expat (XS version)
============================

This module is an XS only implementation of XML::SAX::Expat
which currently uses XML::Parser.

I'm uploading this now to get some feedback while Robin
Berjon (the maintainer of XML::SAX::Expat) is AWOL.

It's not entirely complete, but it should work for most
people's uses.

It is however an awful lot faster than the layer over XML::Parser.
